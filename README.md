# Ingrid

## Introduction
3D rental system using augmented reality (AR) could revolutionize the way we rent and use physical objects. Ingrid is a unique idea as traditionally, renting an object usually involves physically going to a store or showroom, selecting the item, and then either taking it home or having it delivered. With a 3D rental system using AR, the process could be streamlined and made much more convenient for both the renter and the owner.

## How Ingrid works:
* A user looking to rent a property, would simply open an app on their smartphone or tablet. The app would use AR technology to scan the user's living space or work area, creating a virtual 3D model of the environment. The user could then browse a selection of properties available for rent, which would be displayed as 3D models within the virtual environment.
* By using AR, the user would be able to see how each property would look and fit in their space, helping them to make an informed decision about which property to rent. Ingrid provides a map as a location feature enabling the user to chose the best locations.
* Once the user has selected a property, they can complete the rental process directly through the app, paying for the rental or scheduling a meeting time with the owner of the property.

## Features of Ingrid
* 3D viewing of property
* Saves time
* User-friendly interface
* Sustainable
* Transparent rental process

## Benefits of Ingrid
There are several benefits to this rental system. For one, it would be much more convenient for users, as they could browse and rent properties from the comfort of their own home. It would also save time and resources, as there would be no need for physical showrooms or stores. Additionally, the use of AR technology could help to reduce waste and clutter, as people would no longer need to buy and store physical properties they only use occasionally. Instead, they could simply rent them as needed. 
Overall, a 3D rental system using AR has the potential to revolutionize the way we access properties, making the process more convenient and environmentally friendly.
